# Folder Structure Visualizer

## Purpose
The main purpose of this code is to help users visualize the layout of their files and folders within a specific directory. This can be particularly useful for understanding complex directory structures or for documentation purposes.

## Inputs
The code takes three main inputs:

1. **`path`**: The full path to the directory you want to analyze.
2. **`exclusions`**: A list of folder and file names to ignore when generating the folder structure. For example, you might want to exclude folders like `venv` or `.git` that are not relevant to your analysis.
3. **`output_file`**: The name of the text file where the folder structure will be saved. The results will be written into this file.

## Outputs
The output of the code is a text file named `folder_structure.txt`. This file contains a visual representation of the folder and file hierarchy within the specified directory. Each folder and file is listed in a way that shows their relationships, using symbols to indicate whether they are files or directories.

## How It Works
The code achieves its purpose through a function called `generate_folder_structure`, which contains a nested function named `write_tree`. Here’s a brief overview of the process:

1. **Listing Items**: The `write_tree` function checks the current directory and lists all items (both files and folders).
2. **Sorting and Filtering**: It sorts these items and separates them into two lists: one for files and one for directories. Items in the exclusions list are skipped.
3. **Writing to File**: The function writes the name of the current directory or file to the output file, using special symbols (`├──` and `└──`) to create a tree-like structure.
4. **Recursion**: For each directory found, the function calls itself to explore that directory further, building the structure step by step.

## Conclusion
This code provides a simple yet effective way to visualize the organization of files and folders in a directory, making it easier for users to understand their file system.
